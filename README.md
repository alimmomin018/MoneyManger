# MoneyManger
 
This app solves the problem of managing your income and expense for a person/entity that you trust. It works best for when you pay for someone else and they will return you when the amount that they owe is big or when they have money. for example, lets say that you are on a trip and have payed for your friend couple times. You can enter the money that you paid for him as expense and when he returns that money you will count that as income. Thus, keeping a record of money of that person/entity on how much they owe you and can ask for the exact money.
